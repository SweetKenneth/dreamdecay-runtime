# @dreamdecay/runtime

> Some pages do not belong to their authors anymore.

**@dreamdecay/runtime** is a deterministic, reversible *dream-state fracture engine* for the web.  
It takes an existing page and gently breaks it — not randomly, but *remembering how it broke*.

This is not a glitch library.  
This is not obfuscation.  
This is controlled decay.

Built as an artifact of **RCRDBL** and the Dream Eater.

## What this does

- Fractures visible content into a **dream-like decayed state**
- Uses a **seed** so the same page breaks the same way every time
- Requires **no backend**
- Requires **no scraping**
- Requires **no CORS bypass**
- Is **fully reversible** (remove the runtime → page heals)
- Leaves **non-removable provenance markers**

If a page has memory, this is how you wake it up.
